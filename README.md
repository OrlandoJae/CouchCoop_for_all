# CouchCoop_for_all
We're trying to create a platform that enables users to play couch-coop games within browsers.

So what we need is:
- a website which allows users to register and manage their accounts
- to find a proper process for uploading and validating new games
- to enable the website to correctly recognize inputs from common gamepads
  - with up to four gamepads at once
- create some games to try our site
